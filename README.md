# Visualization-data
a few way to visualization data on python by using matplotlib and pygal 

to make it work you need to make virtual environment 

1. create some folder where you will save the project 
2. open teminal and write :
virtualenv venv
venv\scripts\activate

after making virtual environment just use pip to download libraries

pip install matplotlib
pip install pygal
pip install requests
pip install pygal.maps.world
now every code should work
